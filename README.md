## colorParsley()

### A small color parsing utility with no dependencies

Current Version: **0.0.1**_

APCA is a contrast assessment method for predicting the perceived contrast between sRGB colors on a computer monitor. It has been developed as an assessment method for W3 Silver/WCAG3 accessibility standards relating to content for computer displays and mobile devices, with a focus on readability and understandability.

## QuickStart

### *Usage:*
"colorParsley()" send it anything, it returns an rgba array:

```javascript
    let textColor = colorParsley('#111111');
    let backgroundColor = colorParsley('e8e6dd');
```


The following are the available input types for colorParsley(), HSL is not implemented at the moment. All are automatically recognized:

### INPUT as STRINGS:
- **No Alpha**
    - ` '#abc' ` or ` 'abc' ` (interpreted as ` 'aabbcc' `)
    - ` '#abcdef' ` or ` 'abcdef' ` (hash is ignored)
    - ` 'rgb(123, 45, 67)' `
    - ` 'aquamarine' ` or ` 'magenta' ` (full CSS4 named colors list)

- **With Alpha** _(alpha is NOT presently calculated, and assumed as fully opaque)_
    - ` '#abcf' ` or ` 'abcf' ` (interpreted as ` 'aabbccff' `)
    - ` '#123456ff' ` or ` '123456ff' ` (hash is ignored)
    - ` 'rgba(123, 45, 67,1.0)' `

### INPUT as NUMBER:
- **As hex**
    - ` 0xabcdef `
- **As integer**
    - ` 11259375 `

No alpha parsing for _numbers_ in part as there are big and little endian issues that need to be resolved.

### Version History

Current Version: **0.1.1**

0.1.1 â€” (Jan 11, 2022) minor, bug fix for the alpha of a 4 character hex string such as #2228 â€” the 8 (alpha) was not being divided correctly to be in the range 0.0-1.0. (discovered as APCA now supports alpha)

0.1.0 â€” (Jan 5, 2022) NEW! HWB and HSL now added! Revised the regex to improve validations, and to add hsl and hwb. Added string formatting utilities colorToHex() and colorToRGB(), updated docs, Added logo. Cleanup and maintenance.

0.0.2b - documentation fix, added this version history file. No code changes.

0.0.2 - significant change in parsing, now using a single (large) regex, and filtering all at once into a single array, followed by determining which positions in the array contain values, followed by a switch to process appropriately into the return array. All types of strings are auto recognized this way. (previous version iterated an object of multiple regex for each type)

0.0.1 â€” initial split off from APCA into a standalone package.

### Version History

Current Version: **0.0.2b**


0.0.2b - documentation fix, added this version history file. No code changes.

0.0.2 - significant change in parsing, now using a single (large) regex, and filtering all at once into a single array, followed by determining which positions in the array contain values, followed by a switch to process appropriately into the return array. All types of strings are auto recognized this way. (previous version iterated an object of multiple regex for each type)

0.0.1 â€” initial split off from APCA into a standalone package.
